# Simple Startpage

This is just another startpage I made for practicing HTML and CSS.

Save the file somewhere on your computer along with the stylesheet and javascript in the same directory. To set as default page in Firefox:

    go to about:preferences in the search bar
    Search "home"
    In the textbox next to "Homepage and new windows" type the filepath to the startpage.html file
    ex. something like file:///home/user/start_page_directory/startpage.html



There are pre-made icons for popular websites in the icons folder. If you want to make more, make sure they are around 153x153px.

You can also set a background image--just look through the stylesheet for instructions.
